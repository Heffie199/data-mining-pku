# Resources of course "Data Warehousing and Data Mining", Spring and Summer Semester, 2017.

I am a little busy these days (need to read a dozen of papers assigned by Prof. Tong) and will update this page in a few days, maybe before May 3rd. I'm sorry for that and you can read the instruction in FTP server these days. Feel free to ask any questions about this assignment by creating issues in this repository, I will reply as soon as possible.

# Update

- PHP is allowed (the version will be 5.6.25).
- Java is allowed (the version will be 1.8.0_121).
- If you really want to use Node.js, please give a good reason and detailed instruction about how to establish the environment to run your program, and then it can be allowed.
